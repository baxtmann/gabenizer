#gabenizer bot
This is a reddit bot which crawls a specified subreddit for its top photos, runs them through
[facial detection](http://skybiometry.com/), and attempts to replace every face with
[Gabe Newell's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Newell).

His face is scaled and rotated to match the size of the target.

##TODO

	-If target face is angled too far, don't attempt paste
	-If skintones don't match, apply color filter
